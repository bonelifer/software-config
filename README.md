## software config

place the tilda folder in 
/home/user/.config/
doe this before running tilda after intalling it. that way it picks it up and you dont have multiple configs, which it supports but is a headache if you dont need it.  it's hot key will be the "insert" key. You can change this in the config file. But I never find myself using that key. The image gives you the basis for making sure it fills up screen from left to right. Adjust for your monitor size.
